DSA QUESTIONS

Hello programmers!

This is a repository for data structures and algorithms. This has code in C++ till now. But you can contribute code to this repository in any language you know as long as it is correct and perfectly documented.

ROADMAP FOR LEARNING DATA STRUCTURES

There is no well set roadmap for learning data structures and algorithms other than hard work, consistency and practice. Since this is a very vast field, therefore, only regular practice can help you become a good programmer.
If you are a complete beginner then this is what you can do to start learning coding:

1. Start learning the basics of any programming language of your own choice
2. Be patient and while your progress might seem to be slow, remember that learning data structures and algorithms can be a very daunting task and it has a steep learning curve.
3. Practice questions from GeeksForGeeks, Hackerrank and then slowly move onto Codechef. Participate in the Long Challenges.
4. Learn new concepts and at the same time, practice more questions on the above mentioned sites.
5. Now as you become more experienced with coding, shift to codeforces and keep onn practising.
